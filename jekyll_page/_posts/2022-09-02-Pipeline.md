Based on the video from TU Wien on youtube [Pipelines and Stages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENOh4KLGJxY&list=PLmIqTlJ6KsE1Jx5HV4sd2jOe3V1KMHHgn&index=6&ab_channel=ComputerGraphicsatTUWien).

From previous chapter, we understand that we initialize use descriptor commands to prepare the commandbuffers that will be later executed. When the GPU receives such commands it will use those descriptors to know which data to send and schedule the commands, in submission/recording order (although the finish order may differ).

# Pipelines

## Graphics Pipelines
Such commands will perform the following
1. Draw Processing* - Decide if it is intended to be used (clipping, discarding,...)
2. Vertex Processing - Transforming = Translation + Rotation + Scaling + ...
3. Tesselation* - Subdividing the Geometry - Unknown workload
4. Primitive Processing* - Duplicating Geometry (Instancing?), change primitive type,... - Fixed workload upfront 
5. Rasterization - Transform from vector representation to fragment image (not yet pixels as they are not shaded!)
6. Fragment Processing - Computation on a per fragment basis
7. Pixel Processing - Final fragments are stored in memory as an image (presentation, framebuffers,...)

`* Marked elements are optional`

Below are most of the "vanilla" stages of a Vulkan Graphics Pipeline. Some are not necessary and some will not be supported by all graphic cards. There may be more enabled with different extensions too!

### Draw Processing*
*CONDITIONAL_RENDERING(EXT)**

*DRAW_INDIRECT**

### Vertex Processing
*VERTEX_INPUT*

*VERTEX_SHADER*

### TESSELATION*
*TESSELATION_CONTROL_SHADER**

*TESSELATION_EVALUATION_SHADER**

### PRIMITIVE PROCESSING*
*GEOMETRY_SHADER**

*TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK(EXT)**

### RASTERIZATION

### FRAGMENT PROCESSING
*FRAGMENT_SHADING_RATE(KHR)**

*EARLY_FRAGMENT_TESTS*

*FRAGMENT_SHADER*

*LATE_FRAGMENT_TESTS**

### PIXEL PROCESSING
**COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT**

## Compute Pipelines
Very straight forward, single stage that does specific work

1. Draw Processing* - Same as Graphics Pipeline
2. Compute - Completely custom shader!
---

## Raytracing Pipeline
General Available for devices that support the required extensions (`VK_KHR_acceleration_structure` for example).

1. Ray Generation Shader
2. Acceleration Structure Traversal*
3. Hit Shaders

`* Marked are fixed steps`

### Ray Generation Shader
Cast any number of rays per pixel

### Acceleration Structure Traversal*
Check intersections through the HAS (Hierarchichal Acceleration Structure) and decide which shader it should invoke (hit or miss, I guess its never really a miss huh, sorry).
For tarnsparent objects we still need to continue tracing the ray, so we generate more info to work with in the *Any Hit shader*.

### Hit Shaders
Configurable shaders:
*Miss Shader*
*Closest Hit Shader*

### Vulkan Raytracing Pipeline
*Draw Processing*
 - DRAW_INDIRECT
*Ray Tracing (KRH)**
 - RAY_TRACING_SHADER

### Ray Tracing Acceleration Structure Build Commands
1. ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD(KHR)*

---

## Transfer Pipeline
 - Copy - TRANSFER - `VkCommandCopyImage` for example
 - Blit
 - Resolve
 - Clear
---

## Other Stages
ALL_GRAPHICS
ALL_COMMANDS
ALL_TRANSFER
NONE
---

# Synchronization2
Using `VK_KHR_synchronization2` extension - Compatible with all Vulkan versions with newer SDKs

With that, the TOP/BOTTOM of pipeline stages are deprecated and instead we use `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_ALL_COMMANDS_BIT_KHR` and `VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_2_NONE_KHR` for...
Previously TOP and BOTTOM had dependencies on which they had to wait. Ex: RT Top depends on Graphics Bot, now we have to declare that ALL_COMMANDS of RT depends on finished ALL_COMMANDS of Graphics. Semantically similar.

If there are no dependencies, we put NONE.

See all in:
vkCmdPipelineBarrier2KHR
VkBufferMemoryBarrier2KHR
VkPipelineStageFlags2KHR
VkPipelineStageFlagsBits2KHR

# Pipeline Specifics
 - Draw indirect works for draw pipelines, not transfer or accleeration structures (by default it just works)
 - Conditional Rendering(EXT) - Requires the extension and feature active per device, also a dedicated buffer to intake data. It is not required to be done during Draw Processing, but only with Graphics/Compute pipelines for now

## Graphics Mesh Pipeline
Nvidia brought Mesh Shaders, which just released on September 1 for all graphcis cards as a KHR extension!
This pipeline joins all the geometry processing (Vertex Processing, Tesselation, Primitive Processing) and rasterization into a step 
### Geometry Processing and Rasterization*
#### *TASK_SHADER*
#### *MESH_SHADER*

# Running Shaders - Creating Shaders Modules
Based off of [Vulkan Tutorial - Shader Modules](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Graphics_pipeline_basics/Shader_modules)

First I am doing online compile of shaders through Shaderc lib, cause I don't want to actually have a separate tool right now, want everything to be code controlled (bad in a big pipeline, but better for tiny project in my pov, not sure if true).
